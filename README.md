XML Script for CLLE [Click here to download](https://github.com/bojasv/npp-ibmi/blob/main/autoCompletion/clle.xml)

The source by default opens-up in 'Normal text file' mode (bottom-left: highlighted in orange)

**Step 1 - Creating/changing the npp language to CLLE**
> Open the CLLE source (top-left: tab bar - highlighted in green 'pgmclle.clle')
> Go to Language > User Defined Language > Define your language... > *Create New language as CLLE, Save and Exit*
> Now the newly added language is shown in the language list (highlighted in blue), click it.
> You're good to proceed in CLLE dev-environment now

**Step 2** - Confirm dev-env and start using the script
> The current dev-env is shown in bottom-left bar (highlighted in orange)
> You could start by typing at least 2 characters of the IBM i command, and npp will show you the suggestion in a dropdown
> Note: the little symbol on left 'fx' indicates it's a function (well here it's actually an IBM i command)
> Press Tab (or Enter) to auto-complete it

**Step 3** - Getting to know what the command is all about?
